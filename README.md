The [**presentation.md**](./presentation.md) MarkDown file is what contains the actual contents of the presentation. It is written for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), and it may be a bit tricky to setup if you don't know a bit about configuring a webserver. If that's the case, the file [**presentation.pdf**](./presentation.pdf) might be your best option to view it, though that version is a bit outdated (sorry about that).

In case you know how to configure a webserver, all you have to do is to start a webserver on this folder and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:[port]/index.html (where [port] is the port you've assigned). The easiest way to do this is with python3 `python -m http.server`.
